    <h2>How to make simple transaction with cardano-cli</h2>
    <p>For this to work, first we need to install the cardano-node (pre-prod) and cardano-cli.</p>
    <p>First we need to create payment address. For that we use the following command.</p>
    <pre>
      cardano-cli address key-gen \
        --verification-key-file payment1.vkey \
        --signing-key-file payment1.skey
    </pre>
    <p>This will create two files in the current directory. <em>payment1.vkey</em> is used to create the addrees and
      <em>payment1.skey</em> is used to sign the transactions.
    </p>
    <p>No we need to create the address.</p>
    <pre>
      cardano-cli address build \
        --payment-verification-key-file payment1.vkey \ 
        --out-file payment1.addr \
        --testnet-magic 1
    </pre>
    <p>This will create the <em>payment1.addr</em> file which contains the address that is associated with
      <em>payment1.vkey</em>. And because we are creating this address on the pre-prod testnet, we use
      <em>--testnet-magic 1</em>.
    </p>
    <p>We need to have some test ADA (tADA) in this address to send it elsewhere. For that, open the
      <em>payment1.addr</em> file and copy the address. Then go to <a
        href="https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet">Testnets Faucet</a>, paste your address there and
      request your tADA.
